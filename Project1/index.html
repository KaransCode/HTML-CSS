            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, to a Tamil Muslim family. His father,
            Jainulabdeen, was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, and his
            mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam studied physics and
            aerospace engineering at St. Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli, and
            later earned his master’s degree from the Madras Institute of
            Technology. Abdul Kalam began his career as an aerospace engineer at
            the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
            Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He played a crucial role in the
            development of India's missile and nuclear weapons programs. His
            notable works include the development of the Agni and Prithvi
            missiles. Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to
            2007, under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. During his
            tenure, he focused on promoting education, innovation, and rural
            development. He was known for his simplicity and humility, often
            traveling by bus and staying in modest accommodations.
